During my time at my last job, I came to the quick realization that data visualization and wrangling needed to be automated.  I was given 10 page directions on how to grab data from an SQL server, or from an Excel file. I taught myself a little python.  Eventually I had to make UI's for others to use said python programs. This ranges from live data acquisition to data visualization and more.
